# Fibonacci Code Kata
The aim of this kata is to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of recursion 
as well as ways to mitigate the disadvantages.

There are several major steps:
* A first, naive implementation of the Fibonacci numbers.
* An implementation using memoization to improve performance.
* An implementation using iteration.
* An implementation using end-recursive calls.
* An implementation using the Trampoline pattern to fix the issue of potential stack overflows.

The _solution_ branch contains possible ways to implement the steps.
